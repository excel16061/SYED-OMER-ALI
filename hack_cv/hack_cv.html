      <h3 id="workTitle"><strong>Detecting phishing attacks using Python</strong></h3>
   <h4 id="workTitle">FEB-2022</h4>      
    <p>
   This is the tool to detect the vulnerable file's or malicious link from mail of DIR.<br>
      I used Python to make this tool.</p>
      <p>It involves analysing URLs or email content to identify suspicious patterns and indicators commonly associated with 
        phishing attempts.
       Detecting phishing attacks requires more sophisticated approaches, including machine learning algorithms, natural 
        language processing (NLP), and analysing email content for phishing indicators.
        For email-based phishing detection, we used NLP techniques to analyse the email content, identify suspicious URLs 
        or attachments, and check for signs of social engineering.
      </p><p> Keeping in mind that phishing attacks are constantly evolving, and a more comprehensive and sophisticated approach 
        is needed for real-world applications. Additionally, phishing detection often involves using security tools and 
        integrating with various threat intelligence services to keep the detection mechanisms up-to-date and effective so it 
        will be validating with the new threat and update.
       WanaCry is an example of VIRUS(Ransomware) which can be detected now days. But still we don’t have the 
        universal solution on that, to avoid such kind of cyberattacks we implement this detecting scripts.

   <h3 id="workTitle"><Strong>Human Activity Recognition</strong></h3>
   <h4 id="workTitle">NOV-2021</h4>      
    <p>
      This project has been created by using Python libraries and some of its algorithm to train the data and recognizes the 
pattern itself.
The system interprets what a person is doing by deciphering signal fluctuations using radio-frequency identification 
(RFID) technology and machine learning algorithms.
It uses CNN to recognise human activities action recognition kinetics dataset.
 </p><p> builds HAR System with VGG16.
VGG16 and its variants have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and feature 
extraction in transfer learning scenarios.
The program will take the input and process it and give’s recognized object values which captured from the input.
 Implement the basic OpenCV which is used by 90% image recognition system ( Open CV 2 Library ).
 Our experimental results showed the accuracy of 96.95% using VGG-16 with the implementation of transfer learning.

   <h4 id="workTitle">JUN-2020</h4>      
    <p>
      It’s an App which was built on Unity Engine, highly precise on Graphics and wide range of assets been used to have 
      an impressive UI which make it different from other apps.
       I was a part of the team, I designed the project as Home UI and animations.
       It was an immersive great experience for the user while using it as we added multiple scenes for card shifting, 
    </p><p>   swapping cards, Flip animation while taking it etc.
       It was targeted to Teenage audience where the younger can show some skills and enjoy the game, it was created in
      Lockdown period.
       I worked on the designed and animation majorly apart from that the execution flow was be done by the respective 
      team.
       It was a remote project and company located in Mumbai
