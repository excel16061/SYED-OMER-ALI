    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr class="star-bright">
    <p>
      I’m a software developer who likes building clean systems — and breaking messy problems (ethically) until they behave.
      Beyond web/backend work, I’ve spent years observing real-world security incidents around me: phishing attempts, trojan/RAT-like
      symptoms, and ransomware scares. My focus is always defensive and recovery-first — isolate the issue, protect data, clean safely,
      and harden the system so it doesn’t repeat.
      I also explore Android system reliability on personally-owned devices (rooting/flashing concepts, bootloop recovery, and stability
      debugging) for learning and repair — not for bypassing security. I love challenges, clean fixes, and documented solutions.

    <h3 id="workTitle"><strong>Detecting phishing attacks using Python</strong></h3>
    <h4 id="workTitle">FEB-2022</h4>
    <p>
      This is a defensive tool concept to detect suspicious URLs or malicious patterns in email content.
      I used Python to build it as a learning project focused on prevention and risk reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It involves analysing URLs or email content to identify suspicious patterns and indicators commonly associated with phishing attempts.
      For email-based phishing detection, I explored NLP-style approaches to analyse content, identify suspicious URLs or attachments,
      and check for signs of social engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      WannaCry is a well-known example of ransomware. This project is educational and defensive: it helped me understand how to identify
      common phishing signals and reduce risk through validation, safe handling, and user awareness. In real deployments, prevention requires
      layered security (patching, backups, endpoint protection, and verified threat intelligence).
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="workTitle"><strong>Security Observation & Reverse Engineering (Defensive Work)</strong></h3>
    <h4 id="workTitle">Ongoing</h4>
    <p>
      Worked on defensive troubleshooting and analysis of suspicious system behavior reported by local users/community:
      ransomware scares, trojan/RAT-like persistence symptoms, unsafe downloads, and phishing-driven credential compromises.
      My approach is always ethical and recovery-first — I focus on cleanup, evidence awareness, and prevention (not offensive use).
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical outcomes included: isolating affected devices, guiding users to trusted scanning/removal tools, helping restore from backups
      when available, tightening account security (password resets + MFA), and improving system hygiene (patching, safe browsing habits,
      least privilege). I document what I learn so the same incident doesn’t happen again.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="workTitle"><strong>Android System Debugging (Rooting / Flashing Concepts)</strong></h3>
    <h4 id="workTitle">Ongoing</h4>
    <p>
      Explored Android customization and repair topics on personally-owned devices — including rooting/flashing concepts, update recovery,
      bootloop diagnosis, and stability troubleshooting. My interest is system reliability and learning how the software stack behaves
      under real-world constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helped multiple users recover from soft-bricks and post-update issues by recommending safe, official recovery paths,
      emphasizing backups, and explaining risks (data loss, security tradeoffs, warranty impact). I do not work on bypassing protections
      for unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h3 id="workTitle"><Strong>Human Activity Recognition</Strong></h3>
    <h4 id="workTitle">NOV-2021</h4>
    <p>
      This project has been created by using Python libraries and some of its algorithm to train the data and recognizes the pattern itself.
      The system interprets what a person is doing by deciphering signal fluctuations using RFID technology and machine learning algorithms.
      It uses CNN to recognise human activities action recognition kinetics dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Builds HAR System with VGG16. VGG16 and its variants have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, object detection,
      and feature extraction in transfer learning scenarios.
      Implemented basic OpenCV preprocessing (OpenCV 2 library).
      Experimental results showed the accuracy of 96.95% using VGG-16 with transfer learning.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="workTitle"><Strong>Cards Game (Teen Patti App)</Strong></h3>
    <h4 id="workTitle">JUN-2020</h4>
    <p>
      It’s an App built on Unity Engine with high quality graphics and a wide range of assets for an impressive UI.
      I was a part of the team; I designed the Home UI and animations.
      Added multiple scenes for card shifting, swapping cards, and flip animations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Targeted teenage audience during the lockdown period. Remote project with a company located in Mumbai.
      I worked mainly on design and animation; execution flow was handled by the respective team.
